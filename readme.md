# AI Landmark Recognition With TensorFlow Lite and CameraX on Android

This project aims to demonstrate how to implement AI-powered landmark recognition using TensorFlow Lite and CameraX on Android devices. By leveraging pre-trained models, specifically [this model](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/landmarks/frameworks/tensorFlow1/variations/classifier-europe-v1) provided by Google, the application can accurately identify landmarks in real-time.

## Model Used
The model utilized in this project is the Google-provided landmark recognition model. It has been trained on various landmarks across Europe to recognize them efficiently. You can find the model [here](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/landmarks/frameworks/tensorFlow1/variations/classifier-europe-v1).
